# TODO

### Markdown Tutorial

For exo:

* [ ] Unchecked
* [x] Checked

1. [ ] Unchecked, ordered
2. [x] Checked, ordered

Use ordered if things must be done in a certain order
Use unordered if things dont need to be done in a certain order

1. [ ] Unchecked, ordered
   * [x] Checked
   * [ ] Unchecked
2. [x] Checked, ordered
   * [x] Checked
   * [x] Checked

Use nested lists to split big tasks into smaller subtasks,
such that when all the small tasks are done, the big one is done too.
Ideally, we should have the subtasks be unordered.
